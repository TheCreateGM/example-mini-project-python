# Mini Project Python

## Overview
This mini project repository is designed for beginners and students who are learning Python programming. It demonstrates how to create simple applications using Tkinter for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and SQLite for database management. Through these projects, users will gain hands-on experience with essential Python concepts, including:

- Event-driven programming
- GUI design with Tkinter
- Database interactions using SQLite
- Implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- Structuring and organizing Python projects

Each project in this repository provides practical examples to help learners understand how to integrate a database with a GUI application and develop small-scale applications that can be expanded with additional features.
